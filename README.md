# Library Management System

## Description:
The Library Management System is a basic C# console application designed to manage books and users in a library. This project focuses on implementing key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

This system models a library that contains different types of books (e.g., Comic, Novel, TextBook, ResearchPaper) and users who interact with the library's inventory.

## Features:
- Book Management:
Add books to the library.
View details of available books.
Categorize books into different types (Comic, Novel, TextBook, ResearchPaper).

- User Management:
Add and manage library users.
Allow users to borrow and return books.

- Library Operations:
Borrow books: Users can borrow books from the library if available.
Return books: Users can return borrowed books.
Check book availability: View the status of books (available/borrowed).

### Future Enhancements:
Implement a database to persist data for books and users.
Add advanced features like book search by title/author and user borrowing limits.
Create a graphical interface for better usability.
